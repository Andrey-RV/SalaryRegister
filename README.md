# Salary register project

This Python project is a prototype of a salary register script that runs in the terminal. The program prompts the user to input the number of employees and their names. Then, for each month and employee, the program requests information about their base salary, bonuses earned during the month, and any overtime work.

The salary calculation assumes that payment is made on a monthly basis rather than an hourly wage, and that employees work 220 hours per month.

## Requirements
 -   Python 3.10 to avoid errors about the use of the new type union operators | (PEP 604).
